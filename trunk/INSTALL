1. CMAKE:
WARNING: do not use cmake 2.0.2 it has a bug which is critical for building 
regedit. 

this package uses cmake (http://www.cmake.org) for generating Makefiles:

use an external build dir, otherwise cmake will polute the sourcedir with lots
of files:

	tar -xzf regedit-<version>.tar.gz
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../regedit
	make
	./regedit 

2. QMAKE:
	tar -xzf regedit-<version>.tar.gz
	mkdir build
	cd build
	qmake ../regedit/regedit.pro
	make
	./regedit

3. ICON SUPPORT
	after the first start of regedit a key named user/sw/regedit/gui/iconDir
	is created. point this key to the path of the regedit/icons directory.
