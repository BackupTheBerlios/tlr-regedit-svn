WARNING: do not use cmake 2.0.2 it has a bug which is critical for building

this package uses cmake (http://www.cmake.org) for generating Makefiles:

use an external build dir, otherwise cmake will polute the sourcedir with lots
of files:

	tar -xzf regedit-<version>.tar.gz
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ../regedit
	make
	./regedit 

2. QMAKE:
	tar -xzf regedit-<version>.tar.gz
	mkdir build
	cd build
	qmake ../regedit/regedit.pro
	make
	./regedit

3. ICON SUPPORT
	if you have installed this software not whith a binary package then you 
	need to set a key named user/sw/regedit/gui/iconDir. point this key to the 
	path of the regedit/icons directory. you can find the icons at the sourcedir
	under icons.
