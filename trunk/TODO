TODO List for regedit:
	
	* implement deleting of keys	(what about deleting whole dirs recursively)
	* implement adding new keys	(done)
	* reflect type of key in tree with icons (done with icon limitations)
	* implement updating keys	(implemented - type updates missing, needed?)
	* rethink gui placement of time stamps (done; updated position in gui; it does'nt use that much place than before)
	  michael suggested that time stamps are not used that often for placing it at toplevel of the gui
	* implement setting the type of a key (binary or string)
	* implement object 
	* implement uid gid checking showing real values (user name, group name) not integers (done)
	* use the registry to store window attributes (done)
	* implement undo/redo (IMPORTANT!!!!)
	  maybe: store a KeySet of deleted/inserted keys
	* overthink deleting/inserting of keys
	  seems to be strange that deleting and inserting of keys is done without applying
	  maybe: use a global save button; replace apply/revoke with global save/undo redo
	* make regedit autodetect where the iconDir should point to. can be made through
	  getabspath(getcwd() + (argv[0] - "regedit"))
	* XML import/export of subtrees
	* check first for app settings in system/sw/regedit/... and then in user/sw/regedit/... (done)
	* find a way to look at other users keys (user:otheruser/key/)
