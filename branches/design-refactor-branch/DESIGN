Pattern: MVC

Model: 	The key database is fully implemented by the elektra software.
View: 	The actual layout is handeled by Qt and the Qt designer.
	The view is source of the most events. The events and their followed
	actions should be clear defined.
Controller:
	The actual logic should happen in here. The Controller is the destination
	of the most events. Delegates some of the work to the Command classes. Handles
	undo/redo. etc. 

Pattern: Observer
	Separate the view from the controller. Opens the possibility of adding more
	Observers (console ui, logging facilities, ...). Clean event propagation.
